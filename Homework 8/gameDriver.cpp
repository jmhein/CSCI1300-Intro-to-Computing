// Homework 8 - Problem 4

/* Algorithm: 
   1) Set variables to hold team 1 and team 2 totals, and a string for the winner
   2) Check that both teams have 4 or more players - winner = "forfeit" if false
   3) Sum the points of the first four players from each team using for loop and "getPlayerPoints" member function
   4) If team1 total > team2 total - winner equals team1 (use "getTeamName" member function)
   5) Else if team2 toatl > team1 total - winner equals team2 (use "getTeamName" mamber function)
   6) Else winner equals "draw"
   7) return winner
