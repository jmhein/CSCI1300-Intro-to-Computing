// Homework 4 - Problem 4

/* Algorithm: 
    1) Initialize chessBoard function above main, with character variable "character" and integer vairable "number"
Within function:
    2) Conditional if character > h OR < a OR number > 8 OR number < 1, print "Chessboard squares can only have letters between a-h and numbers between 1-8"
    3) Since char variables are assigned a numberic value, we can check if the letter is even or odd
    4) Check if character is even and number is even - if true print black (this covers half of the "black" options, letters b, d, f, h)
    5) Check if character is odd and number is odd - if true print black (this covers the other half of the "black" options, letters a, c, e g)
    6) Else print white (only other options)
